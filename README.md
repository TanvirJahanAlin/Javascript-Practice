# Javascript Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Javascript Practice** repository!  
This project is a collection of basic to intermediate JavaScript programs that I developed while practicing important concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## üõ† Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen core JavaScript knowledge.
- Practice common logical patterns and coding structures.
- Build a foundation for solving real-world programming challenges.

## üìÇ Contents

This repository includes small but important scripts covering:

| `whileLoop.js`              | Using the `while` loop.                     |
| `oddEven.js`                | Check if a number is odd or even.           |
| `factorial.js`              | Finding factorial using iteration.         |
| `factorialRecursive.js`     | Finding factorial using recursion.         |
| `maximumValue.js`           | Finding the maximum value in an array.      |
| `minimumValue.js`           | Finding the minimum value in an array.      |
| `return.js`                 | Understanding the use of the `return` keyword. |
| `dataParameterization.js`   | Functions with parameter inputs.            |
| `Calculator.js`             | Simple calculator operations.              |

## üìö Topics Covered

- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Expressions
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and Parameters
- Arrays and Array Operations
- Recursion
- Control Flow with Switch Cases and Ternary Operators

## üöÄ How to Run

 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanvirJahanAlin/Javascript-Practice.git
```
 2. Open any `.js` file in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).
 3. Run the file using Node.js or directly in the browser console.
 
   Example using Node.js:
```bash
node filename.js
```

## üìà Future Improvements

-   Add more complex practice problems (sorting algorithms, data structures).
    
-   Organize codes into topic-based folders.
    
-   Include comments and explanations inside each script.
